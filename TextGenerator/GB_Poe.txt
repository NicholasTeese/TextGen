THE RAVEN

Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
T is some visiter I muttered tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more

Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
This it is and nothing more

Presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
Sir said I or Madam truly your forgiveness I implore
But the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rapping
And so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door
That I scarce was sure I heard you here I opened wide the door
Darkness there and nothing more

Deep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word Lenore
This I whispered and an echo murmured back the word Lenore
Merely this and nothing more

Back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before
Surely said I surely that is something at my window lattice
Let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
T is the wind and nothing more

Open here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore
Not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he
But with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
Perched and sat and nothing more

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou I said art sure no craven
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nights Plutonian shore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
With such name as Nevermore

But the Raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
That one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
Nothing further then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered
Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before
On the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
Then the bird said Nevermore

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
Doubtless said I what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of Never nevermore

But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door
Then upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking Nevermore

This I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
This and more I sat divining with my head at ease reclining
On the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated over
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating over
She shall press ah nevermore

Then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
Wretch I cried thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore
Quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore

Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil
Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted
On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly I implore
Is there is there balm in Gilead tell me tell me I implore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore

Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil
By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore

Be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend I shrieked upstarting
Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shore
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door
Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
Quoth the Raven Nevermore

And the Raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
And the lamplight over him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted nevermore

THE BELLS

Hear the sledges with the bells
Silver bells
What a world of merriment their melody foretells
How they tinkle tinkle tinkle
In their icy air of night
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells

Hear the mellow wedding bells
Golden bells
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight
From the molten golden notes
And all in tune
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle dove that listens while she gloats
On the moon
Oh from out the sounding cells
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells
How it swells
How it dwells
On the future how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells

Hear the loud alarm bells
Brazen bells
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright
Too much horrified to speak
They can only shriek shriek
Out of tune
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher higher higher
With a desperate desire
And a resolute endeavor
Now now to sit or never
By the side of the pale faced moon
Oh the bells bells bells
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair
How they clang and clash and roar
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air
Yet the ear it fully knows
By the twanging
And the clanging
How the danger ebbs and flows
Yet the ear distinctly tells
In the jangling
And the wrangling
How the danger sinks and swells
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
Of the bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells

Hear the tolling of the bells
Iron bells
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels
In the silence of the night
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan
And the people ah the people
They that dwell up in the steeple
All alone
And who toiling toiling toiling
In that muffled monotone
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone
They are neither man nor woman
They are neither brute nor human
They are Ghouls
And their king it is who tolls
And he rolls rolls rolls
Rolls
A pæan from the bells
And his merry bosom swells
With the pæan of the bells
And he dances and he yells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the pæan of the bells
Of the bells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the throbbing of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the sobbing of the bells
Keeping time time time
As he knells knells knells
In a happy Runic rhyme
To the rolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the tolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells

ULALUME

The skies they were ashen and sober
The leaves they were crisped and sere
The leaves they were withering and sere
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber
In the misty mid region of Weir
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber
In the ghoul haunted woodland of Weir

Here once through an alley Titanic
Of cypress I roamed with my Soul
Of cypress with Psyche my Soul
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole

Our talk had been serious and sober
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere
Our memories were treacherous and sere
For we knew not the month was October
And we marked not the night of the year
Ah night of all nights in the year
We noted not the dim lake of Auber
Though once we had journeyed down here
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber
Nor the ghoul haunted woodland of Weir

And now as the night was senescent
And stardials pointed to morn
As the sun dials hinted of morn
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn
Astartes bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn

And I said She is warmer than Dian
She rolls through an ether of sighs
She revels in a region of sighs
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks where the worm never dies
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies
To the Lethean peace of the skies
Come up in despite of the Lion
To shine on us with her bright eyes
Come up through the lair of the Lion
With love in her luminous eyes

But Psyche uplifting her finger
Said Sadly this star I mistrust
Her pallor I strangely mistrust
Oh hasten oh let us not linger
Oh fly let us fly for we must
In terror she spoke letting sink her
Wings till they trailed in the dust
In agony sobbed letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust

I replied This is nothing but dreaming
Let us on by this tremulous light
Let us bathe in this crystalline light
Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty tonight
See it flickers up the sky through the night
Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming
And be sure it will lead us aright
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night

Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her
And tempted her out of her gloom
And conquered her scruples and gloom
And we passed to the end of a vista
But were stopped by the door of a tomb
By the door of a legended tomb
And I said What is written sweet sister
On the door of this legended tomb
She replied Ulalume Ulalume
Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere
As the leaves that were withering and sere
And I cried It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed I journeyed down here
That I brought a dread burden down here
On this night of all nights in the year
Ah what demon has tempted me here
Well I know now this dim lake of Auber
This misty mid region of Weir
Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber
This ghoul haunted woodland of Weir

TO HELEN

I saw thee once once only years ago
I must not say how many but not many
It was a July midnight and from out
A full orbed moon that like thine own soul soaring
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven
There fell a silvery silken veil of light
With quietude and sultriness and slumber
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden
Where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe
Fell on the upturned faces of these roses
That gave out in return for the love light
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death
Fell on the upturned faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre enchanted
By thee and by the poetry of thy presence

Clad all in white upon a violet bank
I saw thee half reclining while the moon
Fell on the upturned faces of the roses
And on thine own upturned alas in sorrow

Was it not Fate that on this July midnight
Was it not Fate whose name is also Sorrow
That bade me pause before that garden gate
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses
No footstep stirred the hated world all slept
Save only thee and me O Heaven O God
How my heart beats in coupling those two words
Save only thee and me I paused I looked
And in an instant all things disappeared
Ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted
The pearly lustre of the moon went out
The mossy banks and the meandering paths
The happy flowers and the repining trees
Were seen no more the very roses odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs
All all expired save thee save less than thou
Save only the divine light in thine eyes
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
I saw but them they were the world to me
I saw but them saw only them for hours
Saw only them until the moon went down
What wild heart histories seemed to lie unwritten
Upon those crystalline  celestial spheres
How dark a woe yet how sublime a hope
How silently serene a sea of pride
How daring an ambition yet how deep
How fathomless a capacity for love

But now at length dear Dian sank from sight
Into a western couch of thunder cloud
And thou a ghost amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away Only thine eyes remained
They would not go they never yet have gone
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night
They have not left me as my hopes have since
They follow me they lead me through the years

They are my ministers yet I their slave
Their office is to illumine and enkindle
My duty to be saved by their bright light
And purified in their electric fire
And sanctified in their elysian fire
They fill my soul with Beauty which is Hope
And are far up in Heaven the stars I kneel to
In the sad silent watches of my night
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still two sweetly scintillant
Venuses unextinguished by the sun

ANNABEL LEE

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of ANNABEL LEE
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my ANNABEL LEE
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful ANNABEL LEE
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea

The angels not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE
And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE
And so all the night tide I lie down by the side
Of my darling my darling my life and my bride
In her sepulchre there by the sea
In her tomb by the side of the sea

A VALENTINE

For her this rhyme is penned whose luminous eyes
Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda
Shall find her own sweet name that nestling lies
Upon the page enwrapped from every reader
Search narrowly the lines they hold a treasure
Divine a talisman an amulet
That must be worn at heart Search well the measure
The words the syllables Do not forget
The trivialest point or you may lose your labor
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
Which one might not undo without a sabre
If one could merely comprehend the plot
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
Eyes scintillating soul there lie perdus
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
Of poets by poets as the name is a poets too
Its letters although naturally lying
Like the knight Pinto Mendez Ferdinando
Still form a synonym for Truth Cease trying 
You will not read the riddle though you do the best you can do

AN ENIGMA

Seldom we find says Solomon Don Dunce
Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a Naples bonnet
Trash of all trash how can a lady don it
Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff
Owldowny nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunk paper the while you con it
And veritably Sol is right enough
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles  ephemeral and so transparent
But this is now you may depend upon it
Stable opaque immortal all by dint
Of the dear names that lie concealed within it

TO MY MOTHER

Because I feel that in the Heavens above
The angels whispering to one another
Can find among their burning terms of love
None so devotional as that of Mother
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you
You who are more than mother unto me
And fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you
In setting my Virginias spirit free
My mother my own mother who died early
Was but the mother of myself but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soul life
